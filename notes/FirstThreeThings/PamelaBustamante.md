how to execute it in the command line, without the repl or other ide

how to write a very simple code, maybe something that finds the odd numbers up until a number that the user defines, or something alike
If you could show me an example of how good can Julia be (how fast and "simple to code"), that would be awesome

ahh and maybe if you could say that you don't always have to start from zero, as on github there are many examples of maybe the same thing that you are trying to code.
